## Reporting a Vulnerability
If your problem is related to security, then you need to **report it as a vulnerability** by following the instructions below.
If it isn't, report it through **[issues](https://github.com/denis0001-dev/AIP-Website/issues/new/choose)**.
Examples:

| Test case                                      | Report as     |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| _The app locker works unstable_                | Vulnerability |
| _The app isn't locked, i want a password lock_ | Issue         |

If this is a _security feature_, report it through issues.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please **don't** report through issues, because this will reveal the vulnerability.
